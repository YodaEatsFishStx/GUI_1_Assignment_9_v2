 The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the use of AngularJS.
 Data is to be read from a JSON file via Ajax and dispalyed to the user.
 The user can then manipulate the data in some way.
 
 For this assignment I created a setlist/playlist maker. A list of Led Zeppelin
 songs taken from a JSON file are shown. The user may then use check-boxes to
 select songs which are to be added to a 2nd list. The ordering of the 2nd list
 may be manipulated by either clicking on a pair of songs which can be swapped,
 or by using a radio button to select a song that may be moved with up and down
 buttons. A running total of the length is shown at the bottom of the list.
 All of the listed information as well as the total length are filtered using
 AngularJS. The ng-class attribute is also used to add and remove classes
 which allow color coding of various states, such as showing which songs are 
 active.
 
 
 The majority of this code is based on the examples provided by Curran Kelleher
 which can be found at the following URL: 
 http://curran.github.io/screencasts/introToAngular/exampleViewer/#/
 
 Other parts of the code were taken from the sample code provided by 
 Prof. Jesse Heines for his GUI Programming 1 course at UMass Lowell.
 
 This file includes several custom function and makes extensive use of the AngularJS
 framework to control the page's behavior.
